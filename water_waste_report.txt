Your waste makes up 0,00% of the daily total waste.


Worldwide, agriculture alone consumes 70% of the world's freshwater, while households account for around 10%.

In Brazil alone, we use up to 7 trillion liters annually, 19 billion per day on agriculture.

Can you even imagine how much is that? Here in Brazil, half of the water consumption is for the population, the other half is the industry.

Sure, we use that to make food. But have you ever considered how much is wasted?

Cassava (Mandioca)? 216% goes to the trash. Corn? 109%. Soy? That one that they burn our forest for? 150%.

All this food, that could be used to save people on the street, going into the trash for not being pretty enough.

And we didn't even talk about half of the water used being wasted by lack of maintenance on pipes and water supplies.

And as an extra, now that water is full of poisonous fluids. And it's going back to you...

Taking that 5 min bath ain't gonna do shit. Get up and support some actual causes before it's over.
