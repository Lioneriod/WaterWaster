# WaterWaster
## Description
A Java program to teach about how much we really impact on water wasting on individual actions like "shower of 5min" and so on.

#### Required (By lucas):
- 3x Abstract Classes 
- 3x Interfaces
- 2x Normal Classes
- 5x of already created classes using exception treatment
- 3x of already created methods using exception throws
- 2x Original exception classes
- 5x of already created classes using inheritance
- 3x Classes using overloading polymorphism
- 3x Classes using overriding polymorphism
- toString being implemented on ALL objects
- 1x use of encapsulation
- Use Collections (one List and a Set or a Map) in at least 2 already created classes

#### TODO(By me):
###### **Done so far:**
- ~~Create a base abstract class for everybody else~~
- ~~Create two more abstract classes to use later~~
- ~~Create two classes for industrial and personal use that inherit that base one~~
- ~~Create two exceptions to use later~~
- ~~Exception 1 for basic maths like 0 or negative values in the main inputs~~
- ~~Exception 2 for the same thing, but on the comparison calculator~~
- ~~Create three interfaces for basic methods: display, compare and report~~
- ~~1 Encapsulation~~
- ~~All toString~~
- ~~1 Collection~~
- ~~3 Poly Overriding~~
- ~~3 Poly Overload~~
- ~~Yappersville visit, write down the report with lots of text after use~~
- ~~Find out a way to use the other two interfaces and abstract class lol~~
- ~~Change the display and report interfaces to methods I already created on the classes~~
- ~~More feedback on the terminal about how each choice is adding up~~
- ~~Add all the items I had on todoist to this list here~~

###### **To do:**

- Now to find a way to put the last abstract class to use???
- Check with teacher for more feedback
